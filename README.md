# Sorting Algorithms Demo

## Christian Lentz 

This repo holds code to build and visualie a number of famous sorting algorithms. The aim of this is to display two things: 

- How do these algorithms work? 
- How do the run times of these algorithms compare to each other? 

Some of these algorithms will make use of some custom data structures. This readme will contain a description of each algorithm, its pseudocode, and its run time. 

### Selection Sort 

### Insertion Sort 

### Heap Sort 

### Merge Sort 

### Quick Sort and Partition Algorithms
